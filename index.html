        <p class="about">
          Chris was born in 1991 to two parents who, thanks to some very
          feminine ultra-sound pictures, were very were fully expecting to give
          birth to their third daughter. As a result, he spent two weeks without
          a name, before his parents settled on "Robert Clark." That was
          rejected by their 6-year-old-daughter, and it was changed again to
          Chris.

        <p class="about">
          In 2013, he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering from
          Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. In 2019, after 5-1/2 years of
          working as a mechanical engineer, he decided that he desperately
          wanted to pursue a career that would never force him to use a hammer
          on anything ever again.
        </p>
        <p class="about">
          He has some rudimentary skills with python, and has been experimenting
          with creating an emulation of one of his favorite old boardgames using
          PyGame. He's got pathfinding and map drawing down, and is working on
          figuring out how to use sprites. Future project goals include making a
          few apps, including a means of playing drinking games with people in
          other states, so that users and their friends can continue to make
          poor life choices, even after college ends.
        </p>
        <p class="about">
          Future goals include designing some of the features for self-driving
          vehicles, and also making a fully functional Iron Man suit of armor,
          complete with the ability to create/transform into literally anything
          that the plot requires of it. One of these stretch goals seems far,
          far more likely than the other, especially if we're coding all of this
          in strictly HTML, CSS, and Java.
